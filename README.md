# HackReason-2022 2ND PLACE WINNER

This hackathon asked participants to utilize prolog with the s(CASP) library developed by UT Dallas in collaboration with IMDEA, Spain. The s(CASP) system is used to automate common sense reasoning, which was the overall goal of this project.

This project was developed in a team of 4 individuals [2 sophomores, 2 freshman]. We decided to use prolog and the s(CASP) system to automate the reasoning for a student being at risk of dropping out of college/school, and then providing advice to prevent it from happening.  

**INSPIRATION**  
Each year, around one million students drop out of college. This statistic is only increasing in both college and secondary school, and it is caused by factors such as drugs, mental health issues, high stress, physical health issues, and socio-economic issues just to name a few. RISE was developed to help students and parents determine if a student is at risk of dropping out of school, and provides advice to prevent this from happening.   

**HOW WE BUILT IT**   
Our system was built through understanding that first, we must determine whether or not a student is at risk of failing out of school or dropping out. To do this, we brainstormed facts that are associated with how students could be categorized into either being at risk, maybe at risk, or not at risk. Using a students current academic record and their behavior, we were able to build a model that effectively decides which category a student fits into. After this, we needed to build a model that, when a student is place in at risk or maybe at risk, analyzed why this student is placed in the category. Through a model that utilizes a both a student’s current and past social and academic history, we were determine the reason for why a student is at risk.  

**HOW IT WORKS**    
Our system analyzes if a student is at risk of dropping out of school. To calculate whether a student is at risk, factors taken into account are how the student is performing academically and socially at the present. Once the risk level of a student is determined, our program uses a student’s academic and social history to determine which reason a student might be on the verge of failing/dropping out, and a recommendation is given based on said reason.
